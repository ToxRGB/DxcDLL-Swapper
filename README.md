# DxcDLL-Swapper
A small bat file that swaps amdx*.dll files in the driver folder and lets you decide when to use dll with FSR 4 INT8 support or regular dll for the latest DX12 optimizations, AntiLag 2, and for games with anti-cheat. Needed for RDNA 2 users, due to RDNA 4 having official FSR 4 support and RDNA 3 not requiring changing amdx*.dll files.
